Students at the College of Mount Saint Vincent held the school's very first climate walkout, joining hundreds of youths around the globe in protest for climate responsibility.

  
On Friday, students around the world all joined together in the biggest of many climate strikes organized by Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmental activist. Since 2018 the school strike for climate movement has inspired thousands of school-wide protests. 

  
At CMSV the student strike was organized by Wantoe Wantoe, a Liberian student who has been involved in climate advocacy since he was nine years old. Wantoe was a drafting member in the United Nations civil societies “youth climate compact”.

 “Where I'm from the importance of climate change has to do with rising oceans. We have hundreds of people who live near the ocean” said Wantoe.

  
Day by day weather patterns are changing, living things are starting to go extinct, and people are being forced to move out of their homes. 

  
The great barrier reef is dying because of ocean acidification caused by carbon dioxide in water, according to the Australian Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (2007). Animals like the humble Bramble Cay Melomys are now extinct because of climate change, according to Australian Island Arks, (2018)

  
“There have been five major extinction events in the history of life on this planet ...and we are in the middle of one” Brian Haney, professor of ecology at the College of Mount Saint Vincent. 

  
People from Kiribati are being displaced because of rising sea levels, according to the Guardian (2014). Leading the country to buy land from Fiji to migrate parts of its population. CMSV student Jeniffer Puac in an interview spoke about how her family had to leave Guatemala because of droughts caused by climate change. Puac was also a coordinator in the climate walkout.

  
“Any industrial process that releases carbon dioxide is going to contribute to the greenhouse effect…We like to have this idea that it's kind of what we’re doing like if you ride your bike, do that kind of thing we’re going to make a big impact but unless industry changed their practice we’re not going to make much of a change,” said Haney. 

  
Haney voiced the common scientific consensus that climate change is real and is caused by human beings. On the decade statistic which says human beings have 10 years to solve climate change before it causes irreversible damage, Haney said it was “very optimistic” and that it would require efforts from policymakers, corporations, and people. 

“When I understood the severity and all the facts and science that was coming out I said wow we’re really at the beginning of an extinction,” said College of Mount Saint Vincent student Azisa Herbert 18, Cleveland, Ohio.
