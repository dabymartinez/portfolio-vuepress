On the last warm day of autumn, the papis got out of bed for one last game.

Inside the black metal cages of Oval park in Norwood, the papis began to play a game of hot gay tennis.

It is safe to say that these were not the first pair of balls any of the men here were touching because they served them like pros.

In the cage, stood Bronx native Daniel Arzuaga with his U.S open cap on, his tennis racquet in one hand, and tennis balls in the other. He squeezed the tennis balls shaping them into the words PAPI TENNIS on the metal cages.

Every Sunday from the warm bright days of spring until the cold dark days of fall Arzuaga stands here teaching people in the Bronx how to play tennis.

He carries each lesson that he teaches his students with his enormous heart, his tanned thick skin, his silver hair, and his fiancée William, the designated first lady of Papi tennis.

Arzuaga hosts these events with multiple volunteers during the week to create a safe environment for LGBT people to interact, exercise, and play tennis.

The story of papi tennis begins in April of 2007 when Arzuaga saw a lack of engagement and tennis in his community. The lackluster tennis culture in his neighborhood led him to work with a friend to create Papi Tennis.

“We have these courts in my neighborhood that were severely underutilized… I was like, you know, let me put together a group,” said Arzuaga.

Arzuaga grew up wanting to play tennis. He watched it on tv but couldn’t find tennis lessons. In high school, he tried joining a tennis team but the practices were late and affected his school work.

“I watched it on tv and wanted to play and I looked for ways to play and it just wasn’t accessible to me. There were no courts in my neighborhood. I didn’t know how to find lessons “

Arzuaga took it upon himself to create the tennis culture that didn’t exist in his life while also addressing the issues of LGBT representation in sports.

“It provides a sense of comfort and relief to be amongst a community of people that embrace your story. It's not easy to be fully open and yourself in some sports circles as they can perpetuate negative hyper-masculinity that makes gay men uncomfortable.” Said Rafael Pito Lind, lead for Uber's internal Pride employee group.

LGBT representation in sport has been growing this decade. However, it wasn’t always this way. LGBT athletes have faced and still face many toxic situations that can affect the emotional, physical, and mental wellbeing of people in the community.

“Sports attempt to tolerate gay male athletes when they contribute to the overarching ethos of sport—winning—but try to taint the creation of a gay identity within sport that would see homosexuality and athleticism as compatible.” According to the journal of gender and society.

Many sports teams oppress, disrespect, or don't acknowledge gay athletes. This only changes when a gay athlete is really good. Gay athletes can face more discrimination, emasculation, and mistreatment for errors than their heterosexual counterparts.

Papi tennis helps foster a space for LGBT athletes to enjoy competition and good sportsmanship. And not all the papis are gay men, some of the papis are gay women and some are the unthinkable, breeders.

“We have a couple of breeders,” said William Figueroa, designated first lady of papi tennis while pointing.

This is an example of Arzuaga’s commitment to bringing positivity and support to the LGBT community and all the people in the Bronx and beyond.

Anyone who has ever met Arzuaga or his fiancée can tell you about their enormous hearts. They have helped members of the papi tennis community find jobs, housing, and have fostered a great environment for networking.

“There have been many initiatives that have supported the gay community at large besides just our general everyday camaraderie. We support each other with housing efforts, jobs, and impactful community support like the recent Matthew Shepherd benefit” Said Rafael Pito Lind.

The team mascots Blu and Wiley, a Yorkie, and Shiba Inu provide emotional support and hugs for the team.

“I think in general, gay sports are great. Any way that provides a way for us to not only meet but also exercise and interact or compete and do all the good things sports do- It develops good discipline and mental strength. It's all positive and I love that at this point there are so many different gay leagues.” said Arzuaga

For the most part, Arzuaga does most of the administration work on the team. And even though he may get tired, he never gives up on his team.

“I wish I had 48 hours in a day and I wish I had a personal assistant, and even then things wouldn't get done. The administrative work can bog you down... but Its worths worthwhile, it all comes together when I walk on the courts and I see everybody smiling and everybody saying hi to each other, everybody playing tennis, and everybody going out to dinner afterward and just watching those bonds form and solidify,” said Arzuaga.

After the game, the papis go out to have dinner in a bar, restaurant, or food market allowing the bonds on the team to grow bigger each meeting.

“My goal was really to create a gay family and that's what I've done. And I will dedicate 48 hours in a day to keep making that happen. Because it's lasting, it's memorable, it's impactful, and it means a lot to a lot of people including me.” said Arzuaga.

“I found out about papi tennis through Grindr talking to Daniel,” said Rodolfo Carrasco, 32, Bronx, NY.

Everyone has a different story about how they joined papi tennis, some of them found it on Facebook and Instagram, others found it on Grindr and Scruff. Some of them have even asked if they could get it on with the teammates after a good game, but everyone who has responded to Arzuagas message has forever been changed.
