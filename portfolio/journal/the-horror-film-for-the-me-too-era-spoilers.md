**The Horror Film for the “Me Too” Era (spoilers)**

Did she make it all up? Is she lying about it? Was she asking for it? Is it all in her head? These are the questions you will ask after watching Leigh Whannell’s new film, the Invisible Man.

The film is a loose remake of the 1933 film of the same name. But don’t let the names fool you, they are different. This version of the invisible man is a psychological sci-fi horror film for the “Me Too” era. Starring Emmy award-winning actress Elisabeth Moss, the invisible man, is a disturbing story that will make you question the person who you sleep next to at night.

Moss’s performance here is phenomenal. Moss brings the best of her experience in the handmaid's tale into her character Cecilia, a young woman escaping an abusive relationship.

The film is intense from the beginning. Giving us a silent and thrilling escape scene where Cecilia leaves her boyfriend's mansion in the middle of the night before accidentally setting off a car alarm.

As the car alarm sounds, a frantic Cecilia runs towards her sister's car and escapes while her psycho boyfriend, Adrian, punches the car window.

Adrian, who happens to be an engineer that knows about optics and light, fakes his suicide and wears an invisibility suit to haunt and torment Cecilia.

Aldis Hodge plays Cecilia's childhood friend James. At first glance, you would assume he is the film's designated attractive male hero. Yet Whannell made sure that Cecilia was the only hero in this film. This is a movie for a “Me Too” audience and anything involving the established male hero saving the day would have left a bad taste in people’s mouths. The film doesn’t even dabble with what would be a romantic relationship between the two characters.

Instead, every moment that Cecilia is threatened by Adrian and his brother, she stops them. And even at a low point in the film where Moss’s character is sent to a mental institution, she saves herself from her ex-boyfriend instead of being saved by the dozens of security guards that came her way.

Moss is a very talented actress. She captures trauma, abuse, and pain in a way that makes the audience empathize with her character and believe that everything going on is real. There are a couple of invisible fighting scenes where a distressed Cecilia is fighting with the invisible man. These scenes show us how believable and real she can make a fight with air seem.

At the end of the movie, you see a distressed Moss crying and sobbing while telling the 911 operator about her ex-boyfriend's “suicide” before silently taunting him with her deep piercing stare. That change in emotion cements Moss’s talent and her place as one of the great actresses of our time.

Although it was released in February, due to Covid-19 the film is now available to stream. It is an amazing work of art and well worth the price.
